# Max_Throughput
Implementation of an algorithm for finding the optimal power allocation for data communication and transmission between a source node with a target receiving node under the influence of other neighboring adjacent nodes.
  * Assumptions 
    - The network system is in a uniform network space i.e. the amount of data power consumed for both sending and recieving data from a source node to a destination node is going to be same through out the transaction.
    - The only interference to the transmission of data between the target node and the source node are the other neighboring nodes.
